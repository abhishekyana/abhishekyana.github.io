<h3>About me</h3>
<p name="about_me" style="font-size: 20px">Since childhood, I was fascinated towards Robotics and AI. Since, Robotics is an interdisciplinery field, I took Electonics in my undergraduation and learned about the software part alongside. As I started learning about the software part I got really interested into Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, In order to make my first step towards my goal I started doing courses online and started solving some real life problems with the knowledge I gained through the courses and research papers I read. You can some of my projects I did here.</p>

    <li><p><b>Inspiration for this Project:</b></p></li>
    <p>One day, I misplaced my bike keys and had to wait for 1hr to get a duplicate key to again get back home, then I thought of a solution that could enable us to have a key that we'll never misplace, then after getting a bit of inspiration from Apple's TouchID, I decided upon using my fingerprint as the key to unlock the bike.</p>
    <li><p><b>Working:</b></p></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Fingerprint scanner that reads the user's fingerprint and unlocks the vehicle if the user is registered else, it'll capture the bitmap of the user if he/she tries to tamper the system, that'll help is getting the details of the person.</li>
        <li>A Biometric authentication system for the bike where a user can use his finger as a key to start the bike.</li>
        <li>When a registered user puts his finger, the fingerprint sensor verifies the saved IDs and the microcontroller unlocks the handle and gives ignition to the bike.</li>
        <li>This system also features an offline server where a user can lend the bike to an unregistered user using a password generated with the time seed.</li>
        <li>It can also monitor the bike's health and can warn the user if there is any malfunction in the bike.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><li>FaceID for MacBook Using HOGs and CNNs:<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6402823718422315008">Post Link</a></li></h3>

    <li><p><b>Inspiration for this Project:</b></p></li>
    <p>Though I have projects that anybody can view, contribute and use. Some projects I have are really private for me. I have a friend who regularly challenges me by modifying some of my private projects. Though I’ve a password for my MacBook, Hiding that big thing and typing the password was cumbersome. Funnily enough, we were like GANs(kind of), I used to change the password regularly using different patterns and methods, He used to spy and open them. Then after thinking, I’ve implemented this FaceID Decrypter for certain specified files. This enabled me to protect my private projects, without having to fear about being teased. Because, my face is my password.</p>
    <li><p><b>Working:</b></p></li>
    <ul>
        <li>When any person tries to open my private projects, the python program will first capture the image from the FaceTime Camera.</li>
        <li>Applies HOGs (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) on the captured image to detect the bounding boxes of the face.</li>
        <li>The detected face is given to a CNN (Inspired by Google’s Facenet) where it outputs a 128 dimension feature vector of the face.</li>
        <li>The vector is then compared with the pre-stored face vectors using the cosine distance for similarity.</li>
        <li>If the image passes through the threshold (85%) then private files which are previously encrypted using Openssl aes-256 encryption are now decrypted.</li>
        <li>If the face in the image is not similar to pre-stored vectors then the program will send the image containing the face to my mail as an alert.</li>
    </ul>

    <li><p><b>Inspiration for this Project:</b></p></li>
    <p>Since childhood, I was fascinated by robots. I really wanted to make a General Purpose Humanoid Robot that mingles among humans kind of like Sci-Fi movies. Since, Robotics is an inter-disciplinary (Electronics+Software+Mechanical) field my passion towards AI and Electronics grew. This project is a small step towards my goal. This is really really fun to work. </p>
    <li><p><b>Working:</b></p></li>
    <ul>
        <li>The python script converts the speech into text using cloud API.</li>
        <li>Then the text is analysed and converted into appropriate tasks for the hand to perform like open and close. </li>
        <li>Then the data is written onto the serial port of Arduino, then arduino will control the servos’ position depending upon the data received. </li>
    </ul>

<h3><li>Dual Person TV - Proof of Concept :<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6438329902474285056">Post Link</a></li></h3>

    <ol>
    <li><p><b>Inspiration for this Project:</b></p></li>
    <p>We all have faced a situation where we waited so long for a TV program but had to sacrifice for our beloved ones. The same happened to me one day, I had to sacrifice for my mother this time. So, Thought of a solution that enables 2 persons to view 2 different channels at the same time on the same screen and after a bit of research and tinkering, I came up with this implementation. This PoC is a small step to show that it’s possible to have a same screen to show 2 different channels at the same time (technically). </p>
    <li><p><b>Working:</b></p></li>
    <ul>
        <li>This project is a PoC to show that two persons can watch 2 different channels on the same screen at the same time. </li>
        <li>This consists of 2 LCD Light Valves controlled through an Arduino that receives serial commands from the Processing sketch that displays the images onto 120Hz display. </li>
        <li>When appropriate image is shown the respective Light Valve is Turned ON and the other is Off, This when exceeds human PoV (24fps) is smooth. </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>The Speech is converted into text using CloudAPI. Internally it uses Connectionist Temporal Classification for transcribing the speech. </li>
        <li>The intent and entity are detected using the Wit.ai’s NLP API. </li>
        <li>The intent is recognized according to the given command, like greeting, recommending movies, OS control etc. </li>
        <li>The response is generated from the pre-defined templates, the text is converted into speech using the native ‘say’ command in the MacOS. </li>
        <li>Recommendation systems is built naively and bag-of-words model is used for Sentiment analysis to reduce the processing time. </li>
